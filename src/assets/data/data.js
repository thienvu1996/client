      desc: "Yoga also improves heart health by increasing circulation and blood flow. In addition, practicing yoga can help lower blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood glucose levels, as well as the heart rate — which can all add up to a lower risk of hypertension, stroke, and heart disease.This helps in reducing the heart rate and respiration while allowing the entire system to relax. According to Dr. Helene Glassberg, cardiologist at the Penn Heart and Vascular Center, “Yoga, like other forms of exercise, can improve your cholesterol and blood sugar levels by improving metabolism, and can lower blood pressure by improving artery relaxation.",
      desca: "Many people think of yoga mainly as an activity that promotes flexibility and balance. But this ancient tradition also includes breathing exercises, relaxation, and meditation. Together, these practices can lead to measurable improvements in factors connected with cardiovascular health, such as lower blood pressure, better sleep, and less artery-damaging inflammation. There are four distinct but interconnected areas in which yoga has specific benefits, not just for heart disease but any disease, says yoga researcher and neuroscientist Dr. Sat Bir Singh Khalsa, assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. Following are summaries of the four areas. Active forms of yoga, such as power or Vinyasa yoga, are listed as examples of moderate-intensity exercise in the federal exercise guidelines. But the less-vigorous forms of yoga (as well as the active forms) boost muscle strength, flexibility, and balance. These features, which are often overlooked in other forms of exercise, are vital for overall physical fitness and well-being, Dr. Khalsa says. Yoga also encourages deep, slow breathing, which helps lower blood pressure by an average of five points after a few months of regular practice, research suggests.",

      desc: "The process of getting good at yoga is a process of getting more refined, more precise, and more effective at returning to this state with the many poses, breathing techniques, and mental exercises yoga offers. The process of getting good at yoga is also a regular commitment to doing this as a form of regular practice.And since yoga is gentle, almost anyone can do it, regardless of your age or fitness level. Yoga is a 5,000-year-old discipline from India. It was developed as a practice to unite the mind and body. There are many branches of yoga.Yoga means “to link,” “connect,” or “join with.” Yoga practice is not a solitary endeavor. You can practice it alone, but its purpose is to connect you to something—your body, your breathing, your emotions, or the things you are doing in your life—your work, your hobbies, your relationships.A yogi personality recognizes that judgment does more harm than good; they strive to observe themselves and the world around them without attaching an opinion. As we become more non-judgemental, we become more equanimous in the mind and spirit — we discover more peace, gratitude, and love towards ourselves and others. The main aim of yoga is integrating the body, mind, and thoughts so as to work for good ends. Modern life style leads to diseases, which are mostly due to poor food habits, heavy daily routines and to air and water pollution in turn easily affect the human body. A daily yoga practice has many great benefits! It helps keep us grounded, centered, balanced, flexible, strong, calm, clear-headed, focused, relaxed, happy, healthy, and free from stress and anxiety.",
      desca:"In day to day life, countless things could take you away from this inner feeling of connection. It could be physical discomfort or tightness in the body, an injury, stress, focusing on the past, obsessing about the future, overstimulation, lack of energy, or various of the other “unfavourable” states of being. One who is good at yoga is attuned to the subtleties of their present state of being and has the tools to bring themselves back to connection. What being good at yoga one day may look completely different the next. An attuned yogi will know how to tailor their practice that day to whatever is going on in their body.For example, an attuned yogi might notice that they are feeling restless and scattered, and would prescribe themselves a long, slow class where they hold simple poses for minutes at a time to balance themselves, and finish the day with a meal of grounding foods full of root vegetables. On another day, that same yogi might observe a feeling of laziness in their body, and do an energizing sequence to rebalance themselves, followed by a day of cleansing to clear their digestive system. This is just a rudimentary example of the mindset of an advanced yogi.For example, an attuned yogi might notice that they are feeling restless and scattered, and would prescribe themselves a long, slow class where they hold simple poses for minutes at a time to balance themselves, and finish the day with a meal of grounding foods full of root vegetables.

      desc: "You can start your children on yoga as early as 3 years. Ministry of health in India provides guidelines for yoga for children from 3 to 6 years of age. But start your children on simple yoga poses at first. Take care to put no undue burden on their young limbs and bones. Children less than 10 years of age can do upto 10 seconds staying in the final stage of any asana / Yoga practice. The total time for the kid's Yoga session should be not more than 20 minutes. Children are advised not to perform asana for long duration and breathe holding practices (Kumbhaka). Yoga exercise has been found to be a feasible school intervention for children with emotional and behavioural disorders and can be effective in ameliorating the symptoms that also pervasively occur in children with ADHD, such as inattention and bad adaptive skills in class (Steiner et al., 2013). Start with some easy movement and yoga songs for kids before moving into any kind of sequence. Kids are great imitators, so a game of Simon Says using yoga poses is a good option. Another idea is to lead kids through some partner yoga poses, which can help them learn to work together.",
      desca: "A mind-body practice that's been around for centuries, yoga focuses on breathing techniques, poses, and meditation. Proponents cite benefits ranging from improved body awareness and flexibility to stress reduction and mental clarity. But did you know yoga's advantages can extend to children as well? Experts say that yoga prepares children to face the challenges of daily life. It introduces cornerstone values such as non-harming, truthfulness, moderation, cleanliness, gratitude, and self-discipline, says Christina Enneking, the founder of Heart Happy Yoga, a studio in Los Gatos, California. Yoga has also been associated with self-discovery, inquisitiveness, improved behavior, and increased academic performance. One study followed 6- to 8-year-olds who regularly practiced yoga for 12 weeks, twice weekly, 45 minutes at a time. It found that the kids demonstrated significant and positive changes in overall motor abilities scores (balance, strength, and flexibility).Since the modern world moves very, very fast for children, it's not long before they feel all kinds of pressure (personal, parental, social) to keep up with everyone around them, adds De Collibus. Yoga functions as a release valve that alleviates pressure and as a foundation to nurture and develop a resilient and resourceful body, mind, and spirit",

      desc: "Slow movements and deep breathing increase blood flow and warm up muscles, while holding a pose can build strength. Balance on one foot, while holding the other foot to your calf or above the knee (but never on the knee) at a right angle. Yoga postures and sequences help to increase the body's range of motion. The mindful approach of yoga helps to ensure that stretching is done safely, allowing the nervous system to release the muscles into gentle, effective stretches. This reduces the risk of injuring ligaments and tendons, which can occur through more aggressive approaches to flexibility training. Releasing tension in the muscles can also help them to relax and let go, helping your body to open up more. Yoga helps to strengthen the muscles that support the body's weight, leading to functional strength. It is also fantastic for building core strength. This improves athletic performance and your functionality in everyday life, while keeping you safe from injury.  It can also make you far more aware of your body and posture, so that you find yourself automatically self-correcting to come into a healthier alignment throughout the day.",

      desc: " In learner-centred methods, the instructor is both a teacher and a learner at the same time. In the words of Lawrence Stenhouse, the teacher plays a dual role as a learner as well “so that in his classroom extends rather than constricts his intellectual horizons”.The teacher also learns new things every day that he/she didn’t know in the process of teaching. The teacher “becomes a resource rather than an authority”. Examples of learner-centred methods are the discussion method, the discovery or inquiry-based approach, and Hill’s model of learning through discussion (LTD).Teaching and learning are the two sides of a coin. The most accepted criterion for measuring good teaching is the amount of student learning that occurs. There are consistently high correlations between students’ ratings of the “amount learned” in the course and their overall ratings of the teacher and the course. These methods are driven by the situational analysis of what is the most appropriate thing for us to learn/do now given the situation of learners and the teacher.",
      desca: "As a yoga teacher, remaining balanced and patient emotionally, physically, and mentally is essential. This allows your students to rely on your teachings consistently from week to week, day to day, and vice versa. While we aim to find balance in certain postures on the mat, there is a kind of balance that goes beyond your asana practice. Emotional and mental balance helps you stay positive, sensitive, capable of forming a deep connection to yourself and others. It allows you to stay present in the moment and feel more centered. It also greatly impacts your teaching skills as you gain more experience, as it drives you towards being more humble and approachable. Successful yoga teachers design a comprehensive class by building thoughtful sequences and delivering them clearly to their students. This doesn’t pertain to just the asanas, but corresponding breathwork and the anatomical breakdown of the body and message behind each pose as well. Additionally, always take every opportunity to be present in your teaching, be it watching your students and offering adjustments, giving anatomical cues, or opening up about experiences relevant to your theme, etc. ",

Where else do we look for spiritual solace in our darker times? While we may have once headed to a religious institution to find our community and pray together, or may have attended a Friday night swing session at our local dance hall to meet people, these gatherings are largely a thing of the past.

The ultimate goal of a true yogi is to experience emptiness so that one can truly experience aliveness. Adiyogi is said to be the only one who fully reached this aliveness, which is 100% knowing and 100% experiential. Christians also understand that trying to become like God is the ultimate kind of pride, the very kind Lucifer got thrown out of heaven for: “I will make myself like the Most High,” he said in Isaiah 14:14.This desire to attain the full knowledge of God found a welcoming home in Hinduism. Experiencing oneness with existence is the ultimate “aliveness” and “knowing” in which “even the divine has no choice but to serve you. You have now enslaved Shiva!” says SJV.",

Stretching helps increase blood flow throughout the body and can help release toxins and reduce inflammation that may be causing pain.
